Several years ago I debugged cl-sdl2 code and came to the beliefe that I needed a properly produced .spec file for sdl2.h.

* Random Notes
- Each llvm version is likely to correspond to a spec versioning.
- The derived functio interface code should not vary a lot because it is a some version of C.
- The sdl2 spec files are about a year old.
- cffi branch 14.0.0 last  update Jul, 28 2022
- c2ffi is version sensitive because of the exact format of the intermediate AST elements.
- cl-sdl2 the spec files were update from 8.0.0.1 to 13.0.0.1 on April 11, 2022
